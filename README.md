## CoralVR
#### By: Amarise Silié and Zoë Breed

Virtual Reality application for Oculus Go intergrated with Unity that lets the user experience the effects of climate change on the coral reef.
The purpose of the application is to educate and raise awarness for the current coral crisis. The research question focussed on during developing the application was: Does visualizingthe impact of climate change on the coral reef in the Great Barrier Reef educate students?

All of the Unity code is located in the folder named: "Coral2019".

### Abstract
The loss of corals in the Great Barrief Reef due to climate change has major consequences for marine and human life on Earth. Communicating the significance of this issue is challenging, as most people are not directly exposed to the situation. Using Virtual Reality, we aimed to create an underwater environment where students can experience a coral bleaching event and learn more factual information about the effects of climate change on the coral reefs. Two user evaluations were conducted in order to evaluate the usability of the program. From the results of these evaluations, we can conclude that the system has educational value and if further developed may help inform students of the devastating effects of climate change on the coral reefs.
